## Filtering Columns and Rows


with SQL, you can filter columns with SELECT and rows with WHERE. Let's try an example with Lahman baseball database. First we need to load the appropriate packages. 


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library (sqldf)
```

#______________________________________________________________________________

####Example 1

Now, suppose we would like to see homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. We could write the following:


```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, yearID, teamID, HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```

#___________________________________________________________________________________

####Example 2

Now, we can list all players from Yankees that have scored at least 40 homeruns:


```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE teamID='NYA' and HR>=40"
sqldf(query)
```

#___________________________________________________________________________________

####Example 3

We can also see those players who had 40 homeruns but didn't have more than 60 strikeouts:


```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR,SO FROM Batting WHERE HR>40 and SO<60"
sqldf(query)
```

#___________________________________________________________________________________

####Example 4

Here is the information from 1970's for Phillies for all players who had more than 30 homeruns:


```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE yearID>=1970 and yearID<1980 and HR>30 and teamID='PHI'"
sqldf(query)
```

#___________________________________________________________________________________


###Order By
####Example 1

We can also arrange them by descending number homeruns: 


```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC"
sqldf(query)
```

#___________________________________________________________________________________

####Example 2

This is the list of players that had at least 400 at bats but had less than 10 strikeouts and it is arranged by the least amount of strikeouts


```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,SO,AB FROM Batting 
WHERE SO<10 and AB>=400
ORDER BY SO"
sqldf(query)
```
